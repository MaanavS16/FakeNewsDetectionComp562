# Fake News Detection : Comp 562
Final project for Comp 562: Machine Learning. NLP Mode for detecting fake news 


The problem of unreliable news being spread rapidly digitally with next to no fact-checking
is a immense problem and results in the rampant spread of misinformation. The negative
effects of fake news range from uncertainty in the fairness of elections, to damage to the
reputation and profitability of individuals and corporations. Market research indicates that
as much as $39 billion is lost annually as a result of uncontrolled fake news. This large
issues establishes a large monetary and societal motivation for the development of effective
techniques to detect this issue.

This project introduces a novel NLP technique to predict fake news through a RNN (LSTM), sequence embeddings, and precomputed sentiment features
